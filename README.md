This approach to capturing tab reselection uses Xamarin.Forms 2.3.4.247, although it has been used with some older versions, and the code it relies on in Xamarin.Forms does not appear to have changed since.

**TL;DR**

This is a fully buildable Xamarin.Forms app which is largely still the template-generated code, and hence a lot of boring stuff.

The interesting bits are:
- TabReselectDemo\TabReselectDemo\MainPage.xaml.cs
- TabReselectDemo\TabReselectDemo.Android\MainTabPageRenderer.cs
- TabReselectDemo\TabReselectDemo.iOS\MainTabPageRenderer.cs
- TabReselectDemo\TabReselectDemo.UWP\MainTabPageRenderer.cs

Everything else is just there to make a functional demo.

**Platform Support**

- Xamarin.iOS
- Xamarin.Android (AppCompat)
- Xamarin.UWP
